The project was rejected by Columbia Pictures, who doubted its commercial potential. Universal Pictures eventually purchased the script for $1 million. Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million.

It received nine nominations at the 55th Academy Awards, winning Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing in addition to being nominated for Best Picture and Best Director. It also won five Saturn Awards and two Golden Globe Awards.

It tells the story of [[Elliott Taylor|Elliott]], a boy who befriends an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], dubbed [[E.T. (character)|E.T.]], who is left behind on [[Earth]]. Along with his friends and family, Elliott must find a way to help E.T. find his way home. The film stars [[Dee Wallace]], [[Henry Thomas]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Robert MacNaughton]] and [[Drew Barrymore]].\\n\\nThe film\\'s concept was based on an [[imaginary friend]] that Spielberg created after his parents\\' divorce. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the unrealized project \\'\\'[[Night Skies]]\\'\\'. In less than two months, Mathison wrote the first draft of the script, titled \\'\\'E.T. and Me\\'\\', which went through two rewrites. The project was rejected by [[Columbia Pictures]], who doubted its commercial potential. [[Universal Pictures]] eventually purchased the script for $1 million. Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million. Unlike most films, \\'\\'E.T.\\'\\' was shot in rough chronological order to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast. The [[animatronics]] for the film were designed by [[Carlo Rambaldi]].\\n\\n\\'\\'E.T.\\'\\' premiered as the closing film of the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on May 26, 1982, and was released in the United States on June 11, 1982. The film was a smash hit at the box office, surpassing \\'\\'[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]\\'\\' to become the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]], a record it held for eleven years until Spielberg\\'s own \\'\\'[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]\\'\\' surpassed it in 1993. \\'\\'E.T.\\'\\' was near–universally acclaimed by critics, and is regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. It received nine nominations at the [[55th Academy Awards]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] in addition to being nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. It also won five [[Saturn Awards]] and two [[Golden Globe Awards]]. The film was re-released in 1985 and again in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots, visual effects, and additional scenes. It was also re-released in [[IMAX]] on August 12, 2022, to celebrate its 40th anniversary. In 1994, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]], who deemed it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\\n\\n== Plot ==\\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400-700 words. -->\\nA race of diminutive aliens visit Earth at night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. One alien, fascinated by the distant lights of a [[San Fernando Valley]] neighborhood, separates from the group, before U.S. government agents arrive and chase the startled creature. The aliens are forced to depart before the agents can find them, leaving their lone member behind. While the agents search the forest, the creature takes shelter in a shed belonging to the family of ten-year-old Elliott Taylor. Initially scared by the creature, who runs away, Elliott spends the following day leaving a trail of [[Reese\\'s Pieces]] to lure it back to his home, where he hides it in his room.\\n\\nThe following morning, Elliott feigns illness to stay off school and play with the creature, whom he dubs E.T. Elliott eventually introduces E.T. to his older brother, Michael, and seven-year-old sister Gertie, who agree to keep it hidden from their hardworking, single mother, Mary. When the children ask about his origins, E.T. displays telekinetic abilities by levitating several balls to represent his [[planetary system]], and later demonstrates other extraordinary abilities by reviving a dead [[chrysanthemum]] and instantly healing a cut on Elliott\\'s finger. As Elliott bonds with the creature, he begins to feel E.T.\\'s thoughts and emotions, being startled simultaneously with E.T. when the creature accidentally opens an umbrella in a different room.\\n\\nAt school, Elliott becomes intoxicated because, at home, E.T. is drinking beer and watching television. Sensing E.T.\\'s desire to be rescued, Elliott impulsively frees the frogs about to be [[vivisected]] in his biology class, inspiring the other children to follow his lead, and romantically kisses a girl he likes because E.T. is watching [[John Wayne]] kiss [[Maureen O\\'Hara]] in \\'\\'[[The Quiet Man]]\\'\\' (1952); Elliott is sent to the principal\\'s office for his disruptive behavior. Inspired by a [[Buck Rogers]] comic strip, depicting the character calling for help with a communication device, E.T. decides to build a makeshift device to \"phone home\", using various parts around the Taylor home. E.T. also learns to speak English, and requests the children\\'s help to build the device. They agree to help find the missing components, unaware that the agents have become suspicious they are harboring the alien.\\n\\nOn [[Halloween]], the children disguise E.T. as a ghost and Elliott sneaks it to the forest, where they set up the device to call its people. Elliott begs E.T. to stay on Earth with him, before falling asleep and waking alone in the forest the following morning. He returns home to his worried family, while Michael searches for E.T., finding it pale and weakened, lying by a [[culvert]]. He takes E.T. home, where Elliott is also growing weaker, and reveal the creature to Mary just before government agents invade and quarantine the house. The lead agent, Keys, asks for Elliott\\'s help to save E.T., stating that meeting aliens was his childhood dream and he considers E.T\\'s arrival a genuine miracle. However, as the psychic bond between Elliott and E.T. fades, E.T. dies while Elliott returns back to normal. Left alone with the deceased alien, Elliott expresses his love to E.T. and its heart begins to glow and it is revived and restored to health. E.T. tells Elliott that its people are returning.\\n\\nElliott and Michael flee with E.T. on their bikes, flanked by Michael\\'s friends who help them evade the pursuing authorities. Heading towards a roadblock, E.T. levitates the boys to safety and lands them in the forest. E.T.\\'s ship arrives, and it says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, who gives E.T. the chrysanthemum it previously revived. Elliott tearfully asks E.T. to stay, but it places its glowing finger on Elliott\\'s head, affirming it will always be with him. The children, Mary, and Keys observe as E.T. boards the ship, which blasts off into space, leaving a rainbow in the sky.\\n\\n==Cast==\\n{{Multiple image|perrow=5|total_width=500\\n| image1 = Henry Thomas Photo Op Nightmare Weekend Richmond 2023.jpg\\n| image2 = Dee Wallace cropped.jpg\\n| image3 = Peter Coyote at Durell Vineyard, Sonoma, April 2019.jpg\\n| image4 = Robert Macnaughton London Zoo, Dec 1982.jpg\\n| image5 = Drew Barrymore Berlin 2014.jpg\\n| footer = [[Henry Thomas]] (left), [[Dee Wallace]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Robert MacNaughton]] and [[Drew Barrymore]] respectively play the roles of Elliott, Mary, Keys, Michael and Gertie.\\n}}\\n* [[Dee Wallace]] as Mary Taylor, a single mother to Elliott, Michael and Gertie\\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Elliott Taylor]], a 10-year-old boy who befriends E.T.<ref name=\"Maltin Top 100\" />\\n* [[Peter Coyote]] as Keys, a government agent bent on capturing E.T.\\n* [[Robert MacNaughton]] as Michael Taylor, Elliott and Gertie\\'s older brother\\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Gertie Taylor, Elliott and Michael\\'s younger sister\\n* K.C.

However, the project was set aside due to delays on \\'\\'[[1941 (film)|1941]]\\'\\', but the concept of making a small autobiographical film about childhood would stay with him.<ref name=\"brode\" /> He also thought about a follow-up to \\'\\'[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]\\'\\', and began to develop a darker project he had planned with [[John Sayles]] called \\'\\'[[Night Skies]]\\'\\', in which malevolent aliens terrorize a family.<ref name=\"brode\" /><ref name=\"Lambie 2019\" />\\n\\nFilming \\'\\'[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]\\'\\' in Tunisia caused a sense of loneliness in Spielberg, far from his family and friends, and made memories of his childhood creation resurface.<ref name=\"brode\" /><ref name=\"McBride pp323-38\" /> He told screenwriter [[Melissa Mathison]] about \\'\\'Night Skies\\'\\', and developed a subplot from the failed project in which Buddy, the only friendly alien, befriends an [[autism|autistic]] child. Buddy\\'s abandonment on Earth in the script\\'s final scene inspired the concept of \\'\\'E.T.\\'\\'<ref name=\"McBride pp323-38\" /> Mathison wrote a first draft titled \\'\\'E.T. and Me\\'\\' in eight weeks,<ref name=\"McBride pp323-38\" /> which Spielberg considered perfect.<ref name=\"20thAnniversaryDVD\" /> The script went through two more drafts, one by [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]] which deleted an \"[[Eddie Haskell]]\"–esque friend of Elliott\\'s, named Lance.<ref name=\"Gaines 2022\" /> Robbins helped create the chase sequence and he suggested the scene where E.T. got drunk.<ref name=\"brode\" />\\n\\nIn mid-1981, while \\'\\'Raiders of the Lost Ark\\'\\' was being promoted, [[Columbia Pictures]] met with Spielberg to discuss the script, after having to develop \\'\\'Night Skies\\'\\' with the director as the intended sequel to \\'\\'Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\'\\'. However, Marvin Atonowsky, the head of Columbia Pictures\\' marketing and research development, concluded that it had limited commercial potential, believing that it would appeal to mostly young children.<ref name=\"McBride2011 pp323-38\" /> John Veitch, president of Columbia\\'s worldwide productions, also felt that the script was not good or scary enough to be financially viable. On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia CEO [[Frank Price]], who had already funneled nearly $1 million into the film’s development (mostly on creature designer Rick Baker’s alien models), was now calling it \"a wimpy Walt Disney movie\". He informed Spielberg that the project was officially being put into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]];<ref name=\"Nashawaty 2024\" /> Spielberg took the project to [[Sid Sheinberg]], president of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], then the parent company of [[Universal Pictures]].<ref name=\"Caulfield 1982 Gossip\" /><ref name=\"McBride2011 pp323-38\" /> Spielberg told Sheinberg to acquire the E.T. script from Columbia Pictures, which he did for $1{{nbsp}}million and struck a deal with Price in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film\\'s net profits. Veitch later recalled that \"I think [in 1982] we made more on that picture than we did on any of \\'\\'our\\'\\' films.\"<ref name=\"McBride2011 pp323-38\" />\\n\\n===Pre-production===\\n[[File:Carlo Rambaldi al Giffoni Film Festival 2010 - cropped.jpg|thumb|180px|Italian special effects artist [[Carlo Rambaldi]] created E.T.\\'s design.]]\\n\\n[[Carlo Rambaldi]], who designed the aliens for \\'\\'Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\'\\', was hired to design the [[animatronics]] for \\'\\'E.T.\\'\\' Rambaldi\\'s own painting \\'\\'Women of Delta\\'\\' led him to give the creature a unique, extendable neck.<ref name=\"20thAnniversaryDVD\" /> Its face was inspired by those of [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].<ref name=\"DVD notes\" /> Producer [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] visited the [[Jules C.

Two [[dwarfism|little people]], [[Tamara De Treaux]] and [[Pat Bilon]],<ref name=brode/> as well as 12-year-old Matthew DeMeritt, who was born without legs,<ref name=\"Sammon 1983\" /> took turns wearing the costume, depending on what scene was being filmed. DeMeritt actually walked on his hands and played all scenes where E.T. walked awkwardly or fell over.

Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the animatronics. [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship\\'s design was also altered to include more lights. The first flying sequence where Elliott and E.T. fly on their bicycle through the forest now had the cape of Elliott\\'s Halloween costume flap in the wind as it appeared to have originally been intended to be, a change done to have the sequence, particularly the iconic shot of them flying past the Moon, match the film\\'s poster and the logo of Spielberg\\'s production company [[Amblin Entertainment]].\\n\\nScenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Mary\\'s dialogue, during the offscreen argument with Michael about his Halloween costume, was altered to replace the word \"terrorist\" with \"hippie\" in response to the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]]. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with [[walkie-talkie]]s.<ref name=\"20thAnniversaryDVD\" />  Spielberg later admitted that he regretted editing out the guns from the film, stating that the film should be left untouched to represent the culture of its time.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2023/film/news/steven-spielberg-regrets-editing-guns-et-censorship-1235594163/ | title=Steven Spielberg Regrets Editing Guns Out of \\'E.T.,\\' Says \\'No Film Should be Revised\\' for Today\\'s Standards: \\'That Was a Mistake\\' | date=April 25, 2023 }}</ref>\\n\\nAt the premiere, John Williams conducted a live performance of the score.<ref>{{cite video | title = Live at the Shrine!

It tells the story of [[Elliott Taylor|Elliott]], a boy who befriends an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], dubbed [[E.T. (character)|E.T.]], who is left behind on [[Earth]]. Along with his friends and family, Elliott must find a way to help E.T. find his way home. The film stars [[Dee Wallace]], [[Henry Thomas]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Robert MacNaughton]] and [[Drew Barrymore]].\\n\\nThe film\\'s concept was based on an [[imaginary friend]] that Spielberg created after his parents\\' divorce. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the unrealized project \\'\\'[[Night Skies]]\\'\\'. In less than two months, Mathison wrote the first draft of the script, titled \\'\\'E.T. and Me\\'\\', which went through two rewrites. The project was rejected by [[Columbia Pictures]], who doubted its commercial potential. [[Universal Pictures]] eventually purchased the script for $1 million. Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million. Unlike most films, \\'\\'E.T.\\'\\' was shot in rough chronological order to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast. The [[animatronics]] for the film were designed by [[Carlo Rambaldi]].\\n\\n\\'\\'E.T.\\'\\' premiered as the closing film of the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on May 26, 1982, and was released in the United States on June 11, 1982. The film was a smash hit at the box office, surpassing \\'\\'[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]\\'\\' to become the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]], a record it held for eleven years until Spielberg\\'s own \\'\\'[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]\\'\\' surpassed it in 1993. \\'\\'E.T.\\'\\' was near–universally acclaimed by critics, and is regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. It received nine nominations at the [[55th Academy Awards]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] in addition to being nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. It also won five [[Saturn Awards]] and two [[Golden Globe Awards]]. The film was re-released in 1985 and again in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots, visual effects, and additional scenes. It was also re-released in [[IMAX]] on August 12, 2022, to celebrate its 40th anniversary. In 1994, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]], who deemed it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;\\n\\n<h level=\"2\" i=\"1\">== Plot ==</h>\\n<comment>&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400-700 words. --&gt;\\n</comment>A race of diminutive aliens visit Earth at night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. One alien, fascinated by the distant lights of a [[San Fernando Valley]] neighborhood, separates from the group, before U.S. government agents arrive and chase the startled creature. The aliens are forced to depart before the agents can find them, leaving their lone member behind. While the agents search the forest, the creature takes shelter in a shed belonging to the family of ten-year-old Elliott Taylor. Initially scared by the creature, who runs away, Elliott spends the following day leaving a trail of [[Reese\\'s Pieces]] to lure it back to his home, where he hides it in his room.\\n\\nThe following morning, Elliott feigns illness to stay off school and play with the creature, whom he dubs E.T. Elliott eventually introduces E.T. to his older brother, Michael, and seven-year-old sister Gertie, who agree to keep it hidden from their hardworking, single mother, Mary. When the children ask about his origins, E.T. displays telekinetic abilities by levitating several balls to represent his [[planetary system]], and later demonstrates other extraordinary abilities by reviving a dead [[chrysanthemum]] and instantly healing a cut on Elliott\\'s finger. As Elliott bonds with the creature, he begins to feel E.T.\\'s thoughts and emotions, being startled simultaneously with E.T. when the creature accidentally opens an umbrella in a different room.\\n\\nAt school, Elliott becomes intoxicated because, at home, E.T. is drinking beer and watching television. Sensing E.T.\\'s desire to be rescued, Elliott impulsively frees the frogs about to be [[vivisected]] in his biology class, inspiring the other children to follow his lead, and romantically kisses a girl he likes because E.T. is watching [[John Wayne]] kiss [[Maureen O\\'Hara]] in \\'\\'[[The Quiet Man]]\\'\\' (1952); Elliott is sent to the principal\\'s office for his disruptive behavior. Inspired by a [[Buck Rogers]] comic strip, depicting the character calling for help with a communication device, E.T. decides to build a makeshift device to &quot;phone home&quot;, using various parts around the Taylor home. E.T. also learns to speak English, and requests the children\\'s help to build the device. They agree to help find the missing components, unaware that the agents have become suspicious they are harboring the alien.\\n\\nOn [[Halloween]], the children disguise E.T. as a ghost and Elliott sneaks it to the forest, where they set up the device to call its people. Elliott begs E.T. to stay on Earth with him, before falling asleep and waking alone in the forest the following morning. He returns home to his worried family, while Michael searches for E.T., finding it pale and weakened, lying by a [[culvert]]. He takes E.T. home, where Elliott is also growing weaker, and reveal the creature to Mary just before government agents invade and quarantine the house. The lead agent, Keys, asks for Elliott\\'s help to save E.T., stating that meeting aliens was his childhood dream and he considers E.T\\'s arrival a genuine miracle. However, as the psychic bond between Elliott and E.T. fades, E.T. dies while Elliott returns back to normal. Left alone with the deceased alien, Elliott expresses his love to E.T. and its heart begins to glow and it is revived and restored to health. E.T. tells Elliott that its people are returning.\\n\\nElliott and Michael flee with E.T. on their bikes, flanked by Michael\\'s friends who help them evade the pursuing authorities. Heading towards a roadblock, E.T. levitates the boys to safety and lands them in the forest. E.T.\\'s ship arrives, and it says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, who gives E.T. the chrysanthemum it previously revived. Elliott tearfully asks E.T. to stay, but it places its glowing finger on Elliott\\'s head, affirming it will always be with him. The children, Mary, and Keys observe as E.T. boards the ship, which blasts off into space, leaving a rainbow in the sky.\\n\\n<h level=\"2\" i=\"2\">==Cast==</h>\\n<template lineStart=\"1\"><title>Multiple image</title><part><name>perrow</name><equals>=</equals><value>5</value></part><part><name>total_width</name><equals>=</equals><value>500\\n</value></part><part><name> image1 </name><equals>=</equals><value> Henry Thomas Photo Op Nightmare Weekend Richmond 2023.jpg\\n</value></part><part><name> image2 </name><equals>=</equals><value> Dee Wallace cropped.jpg\\n</value></part><part><name> image3 </name><equals>=</equals><value> Peter Coyote at Durell Vineyard, Sonoma, April 2019.jpg\\n</value></part><part><name> image4 </name><equals>=</equals><value> Robert Macnaughton London Zoo, Dec 1982.jpg\\n</value></part><part><name> image5 </name><equals>=</equals><value> Drew Barrymore Berlin 2014.jpg\\n</value></part><part><name> footer </name><equals>=</equals><value> [[Henry Thomas]] (left), [[Dee Wallace]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Robert MacNaughton]] and [[Drew Barrymore]] respectively play the roles of Elliott, Mary, Keys, Michael and Gertie.\\n</value></part></template>\\n* [[Dee Wallace]] as Mary Taylor, a single mother to Elliott, Michael and Gertie\\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Elliott Taylor]], a 10-year-old boy who befriends E.T.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Maltin Top 100&quot; </attr></ext>\\n* [[Peter Coyote]] as Keys, a government agent bent on capturing E.T.\\n* [[Robert MacNaughton]] as Michael Taylor, Elliott and Gertie\\'s older brother\\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Gertie Taylor, Elliott and Michael\\'s younger sister\\n* K.C.

However, Marvin Atonowsky, the head of Columbia Pictures\\' marketing and research development, concluded that it had limited commercial potential, believing that it would appeal to mostly young children.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;McBride2011 pp323-38&quot; </attr></ext> John Veitch, president of Columbia\\'s worldwide productions, also felt that the script was not good or scary enough to be financially viable. On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia CEO [[Frank Price]], who had already funneled nearly $1 million into the film’s development (mostly on creature designer Rick Baker’s alien models), was now calling it &quot;a wimpy Walt Disney movie&quot;. He informed Spielberg that the project was officially being put into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]];<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Nashawaty 2024&quot; </attr></ext> Spielberg took the project to [[Sid Sheinberg]], president of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], then the parent company of [[Universal Pictures]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Caulfield 1982 Gossip&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;McBride2011 pp323-38&quot; </attr></ext> Spielberg told Sheinberg to acquire the E.T. script from Columbia Pictures, which he did for $1<template><title>nbsp</title></template>million and struck a deal with Price in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film\\'s net profits.

Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the animatronics. [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), provided by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship\\'s design was also altered to include more lights. The first flying sequence where Elliott and E.T. fly on their bicycle through the forest now had the cape of Elliott\\'s Halloween costume flap in the wind as it appeared to have originally been intended to be, a change done to have the sequence, particularly the iconic shot of them flying past the Moon, match the film\\'s poster and the logo of Spielberg\\'s production company [[Amblin Entertainment]].\\n\\nScenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Mary\\'s dialogue, during the offscreen argument with Michael about his Halloween costume, was altered to replace the word &quot;terrorist&quot; with &quot;hippie&quot; in response to the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]]. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with [[walkie-talkie]]s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;20thAnniversaryDVD&quot; </attr></ext>  Spielberg later admitted that he regretted editing out the guns from the film, stating that the film should be left untouched to represent the culture of its time.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2023/film/news/steven-spielberg-regrets-editing-guns-et-censorship-1235594163/ | title=Steven Spielberg Regrets Editing Guns Out of \\'E.T.,\\' Says \\'No Film Should be Revised\\' for Today\\'s Standards: \\'That Was a Mistake\\' | date=April 25, 2023 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>\\n\\nAt the premiere, John Williams conducted a live performance of the score.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite video | title = Live at the Shrine!
